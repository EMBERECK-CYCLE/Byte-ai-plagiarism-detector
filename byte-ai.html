      <div class="line"></div>
      <p class="yap">Byte AI is a project made for the 2024-2025 International Science Fair. It was created by users <a class="profile-link-hearty" href="https://github.com/HeartDarty">HeartyDarty</a> and <a class="profile-link-embereck" href="https://github.com/EMBERECK-CYCLE">EMBERECK-CYCLE</a> on Github. Byte AI is an AI detector that was created to aid teachers in spotting AI made works being submitted by students, however will most likely not reach the stage of being able to be used in professional/academic spaces. We started learning code just for this project, and have worked long and hard to make this project. This project may not receive updates, and if it does they will be far and few.</p>

        <p class="yap-hearty">Hello! I'm the one that created and designed the website. I never would have expected to be learning how to code for a science fair project or at all, but here I am! I'm glad to see how far we were able to take this, considering we entered this project without any idea on how to code. It felt a little daunting at first, but we managed to make it work!</p>
